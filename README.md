# MyPrototype
 
playable at: https://james-heo.github.io/MyPrototype/PrototypeBuild/

The goal of this project was to make a UFO as the playable character that periodically shoots at targets (the moving/spinning cubes). Initially I intended for this prototype to spawn a goal once all projectiles on a given level were destroyed. Once said goal appeared, shooting at the goal would transition to the next level, with more targets than the last. Once all levels were completed the levels would recycle back to the first. Unfortunately the build I reached only allowed for one level that will not transition into the next due to complications with making the goal function properly.

Note: The build version seems to have some sort of error occur despite working fine in the Unity editor, issue with the build is unknown.
